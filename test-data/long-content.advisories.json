    "details": "This is an extremely detailed vulnerability description that spans multiple paragraphs and includes various technical details about the security issue.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the core Python interpreter's handling of specially crafted bytecode sequences. When the interpreter encounters a malformed code object with specific properties, it fails to properly validate the bytecode instructions, leading to a type confusion vulnerability. This can be exploited by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.\n\nTechnical Details:\n- The vulnerability is triggered when loading untrusted .pyc files\n- Affected code path: Python/ceval.c in the main evaluation loop\n- Root cause: Missing validation of LOAD_CONST argument indices\n- CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nFor more technical information, see:\n- Official Advisory: https://python.org/security/advisory-2025-0001\n- CVE Details: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-0001\n- GitHub Security Advisory: https://github.com/python/cpython/security/advisories/GHSA-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz\n- Related PEP: https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/\n\nMitigation:\nIf you cannot upgrade immediately, you can mitigate this vulnerability by:\n1. Avoiding loading untrusted .pyc files\n2. Using the -B flag to prevent bytecode caching\n3. Setting PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 environment variable\n\nWe strongly recommend upgrading to the latest patched version as soon as possible.",
